Flight Ticket Sales – Business Model Clarification
Parties Involved

There are three distinct roles in the system:

1. Direct Customers (B2C)

Definition
End customers who buy flight tickets directly from you.

How tickets are sourced

You can obtain tickets for direct customers via:

Airline companies directly, or

Third-party vendors (other agencies)

Financial responsibility

✅ Customer owes you

✅ You owe the airline or vendor

❌ Customer never interacts with vendor financially

System behavior

Ticket is issued under your system

Invoice is issued to the customer

Vendor cost is recorded internally

2. Agents (B2B)

Definition
Agents are resellers who sell tickets to their own clients but purchase tickets from you.

How tickets are sourced

You obtain tickets from:

Airlines directly, or

Third-party vendors

Financial responsibility

✅ Agent owes you

✅ You owe the airline or vendor

❌ Agent’s client is NOT billed by you

System behavior

Ticket passenger = agent’s client

Invoice is issued to the agent

Agent cannot see vendor costs or margin

3. Vendors (Other Agencies / Suppliers)

Definition
External suppliers from whom you purchase tickets to resell.

Role

Provide ticket inventory

Bill you for issued tickets

Financial responsibility

❌ Vendors never invoice customers or agents

✅ You owe vendors

✅ Vendor costs must be tracked per ticket

Ticket Financial Structure (Single Ticket View)

Every issued ticket must generate two financial records:

1. Sales Invoice (Accounts Receivable)

Issued to:

Customer OR

Agent

Selling price

Invoice status (Unpaid / Partial / Paid)

2. Vendor Payable (Accounts Payable)

Vendor / Airline name

Net cost

Payable status (Unpaid / Paid)

📌 These two records are always independent.

Required Ticket Fields

Each ticket must store:

Ticket ID

PNR / Booking Reference

AIRLINE_DIRECT

VENDOR

Vendor ID (nullable if airline direct)

Booking Type:

DIRECT_CUSTOMER

AGENT

Status

Key Accounting Rules (IMPORTANT)

Ticket can be issued before payment

Invoice settlement is manual

Vendor payment is tracked separately

Profit = Selling Price − Vendor Cost

System Design Intent (For Replit)

Build a ticket-centric accounting system that:

Separates who pays you vs who you pay

Supports airline-direct and vendor-sourced tickets

Supports B2C and B2B agents

Allows delayed and partial payments

Maintains a full financial audit trail
